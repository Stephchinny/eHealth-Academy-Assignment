        Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <strong>algebra</strong>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong>learn</strong>.<br> 
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. <em>Struggling</em>.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. <em>One idea on top of the next</em>.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole <strong>universe</strong><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
       <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can <em>learn</em> anything.
